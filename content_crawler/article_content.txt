During our meeting, I sought assurances from the prime minister over the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36288638\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">half a billion pounds a year</a> that Wales currently receives from the EU. It is vital that the UK government guarantees every penny of this funding is safe.</p>\n<p>At today\u2019s meeting, I will share with members the immediate measures we have taken following the referendum and our ongoing strategy to protect jobs and maintain stability. This involves the introduction of six immediate measures to help provide assurance to our business community, including: expansion plans to support Welsh exports; looking anew at campaigns in Wales\u2019 overseas markets to promote inward investment; and developing new ways to boost national competitiveness.</p>\n<p>As part of our post-referendum economic strategy, on Monday I am holding a meeting of business leaders and trade unions to discuss how we can help them navigate the choppy waters ahead. My message to them is clear \u2013 keep your nerve, keep investing, and keep talking to us.</p>\n<p>Wales has a great deal to offer the world. As our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/07/wales-team-set-for-heroes-welcome-in-cardiff-after-euro-2016-exit\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">recent footballing performance</a> in the Euro 2016 championship showed, we are no strangers to punching above our weight on the international stage. But we need to consider how to maintain and build relations with the EU once the UK is no longer a member of the union.</p>\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element-rich-link--not-upgraded\" data-component=\"rich-link\" data-link-name=\"rich-link-1 | 1\">\n<div class=\"rich-link\">\n<div class=\"rich-link__container\">\n<p class=\"rich-link__header\">\n<h1 class=\"rich-link__title\">What's the best Brexit Theresa May could get for Britain?</h1>\n</p>\n\n<a class=\"rich-link__link u-faux-block-link__overlay\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/14/whats-the-best-brexit-theresa-may-could-get-for-britain\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<p>I expect the benefits of the common travel area between the UK and Ireland to be a key issue in today\u2019s discussion.
