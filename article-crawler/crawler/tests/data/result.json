But she rejected the idea on the grounds that money should go to Goebbels\u2019 family, thought to include descendants of Goebbels\u2019 siblings.</p>\n<p>Goebbels remained with Hitler in the besieged bunker in Berlin, poisoning his six children before he and his wife took their own lives. His diaries, from 1924 to 1945, remain in copyright until the end of 2015. Copies are in public libraries.</p>\n<p>Hjalmar Schacht was minister of economics in Hitler\u2019s National Socialist government from 1934 to 1937, and was president of Germany\u2019s leading financial institution, the Reichsbank. Dresen said: \u201c[He] helped Hitler finance his preparation of war.\u201d Captured by the Allies, Schacht was tried at Nuremberg, but was eventually acquitted. He died in 1970.</p>\n<p>J\u00f6rg Hensgen, Bodley Head\u2019s \u00adsenior editor, said in reference to the case: \u201cSchacht was acquitted at N\u00fcrnberg, but there\u2019s something deeply, morally dubious about the whole thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dresen believes that other publishers have paid for the use of Goebbels\u2019 diaries. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re the first publishing house who avoided that \u2013 and have been sued.\u201d</p>\n<p>Longerich maintains this case has important censorship implications. \u201cIf you accept that a private person controls the rights to Goebbels\u2019 diaries, then \u2013 theoretically \u2013 you give this person the right to control research,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>He added: \u201cControl of the rights could have included an inspection of the manuscript before publication, which did not happen in this case. But generally speaking we cannot allow such control from private persons, whatever their interests are. </p>\n<p>\u201cIn this case, we are dealing with the daughter of a cabinet colleague of Mr Goebbels. This is an absolutely unacceptable situation. It\u2019s a question not only of morality, but of professionalism for a historian.\u201d</p>\n<p>Part of Random House\u2019s legal argument questions the copyright ownership, because the diaries were supposed to be published posthumously by Hitler\u2019s own publisher. As the offices were destroyed by Allied bombing raids, no publisher\u2019s contract is in existence. But Dresen points to evidence within one of Goebbels\u2019 diary entries of 1936 which confirms the plans for publication, and he argues that the Bavarian government should own the copyright.</p>\n<p>Initially, he feared that Schacht would take out an injunction against the book, preventing its publication altogether. Determined to avoid the destruction of any books \u201con the grounds of a claim from Goebbels\u201d, he agreed to pay her 1% of the net retail price. </p>\n<p>He said: \u201cWhen she wanted to cash in on that agreement, I said that agreement is null and void \u2026 It\u2019s against the moral rights \u2026 You haven\u2019t been entitled to sell me any words as those words lie within the Bavarian government.\u201d</p>\n<p>Asked whether he thought the forthcoming legal case could affect the biography\u2019s UK publication, Dresen said: \u201cFrom a legal standpoint, it could, because the questions are the same.\u201d </p>\n<p>Schacht declined to comment.</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

If you did, you almost certainly grew up on Countdown, the weekly music program that, over 13 years and 563 episodes, made Meldrum the unlikeliest of entertainment icons.</p>\n<p>Molly, a television biopic that premiered on Channel Seven last night in the first of a two-part miniseries, tells his story ingeniously, and perhaps with a touch of sly irony: via a series of flashbacks following Meldrum\u2019s terrible accident at home in 2011, which <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-15/man-rushed-to-hospital-after-ladder-fall/3733838\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">left him with severe injuries</a>.

As a gormless young suburban boy, I mostly took even Countdown\u2019s most anarchic moments at face value. Even so, I\u2019m pretty sure <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmMCPzEllRQ\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">the infamous 100th episode</a> wasn\u2019t the only time the show\u2019s host \u2013 not to mention its guest stars \u2013 turned up on set considerably the worse for wear.</p>\n<p>With his craggy features, Samuel Johnson was born to play Meldrum. More impressive than the physical resemblance, though, is the genuine pathos Johnson invests in the character.

Photograph: Channel Seven\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Meldrum is also fiercely, and physically, loyal, which gets him into trouble with the law and his superiors at the ABC \u2013 especially the buttoned-down executive Alan Wade, played with perfect rectitude by Benedict Hardie. He is ably protected by Countdown\u2019s producers Michael Shrimpton (Tom O\u2019Sullivan) and Rob Weekes (TJ Power), whose main job seems to be to save our hero from himself.</p>\n<p>The show touches delicately on his early family life: Meldrum is raised mostly by his grandmother after his mother is hospitalised due to an unspecified mental illness. Then, of course, there is Meldrum\u2019s sexuality, which became a talking point last month after Johnson <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-29/actor-samuel-johnson-says-gay-kiss-cut-from-molly-miniseries/7124982\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">told the ABC</a> that a scene in which he kisses another man had been cut by Meldrum himself, who thought it was \u201cgratuitous\u201d. (\u201cI wanted the kiss in, I wanted it to be in there, it wasn\u2019t gratuitous at all,\u201d Johnson said.)</p>\n<p>As our first openly sexually fluid television star, Meldrum never really came out because he never really had to: what you saw was what you got. Here, the subject is dealt with mostly via a series of nudges, winks and knowing looks, until a touching scene where Meldrum, who is engaged to Camille (Rebecca Breeds), takes his strung-out, heroin-addicted transgender housemate Caroline (Ben Gerrard) back to his backwoods Victorian home town of Quambatook only for both to accuse each other of running away from themselves.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s these glimpses into the man behind the mononym that made the first episode of Molly so much more satisfying than Never Tear Us Apart, the INXS miniseries from 2014. We see his self-doubt \u2013 \u201cIf this falls apart, no one\u2019s gonna give me another chance,\u201d he says to Camille before Countdown\u2019s debut \u2013 and the more obscure details, like his lifelong obsessions with Egyptology and the St Kilda football club. </p>\n<p>In between all this is the music. Countdown\u2019s influence on a generation of Australian music \u2013 both for better and worse \u2013 is incontestable and Meldrum was at the centre of it for more than a decade. (This extended to his role as a producer \u2013 both on Russell Morris\u2019s epochal flower power hit The Real Thing and Supernaut\u2019s bisexual anthem I Like It Both Ways.)</p>\n<p>The structure of Molly allows for Countdown\u2019s most celebrated appearances and controversies to be gleefully recast: the early support of Skyhooks, the endlessly replayed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0XglU6-Sjs\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">interview</a>\u201d with a loaded Iggy Pop and the later refusal of Midnight Oil to appear. Along with Cold Chisel\u2019s trashing of the Countdown awards set in 1981, their withdrawal signalled the beginning of a waning in the show\u2019s agenda-setting power. <br/></p>\n<p>But the best moment \u2013 indeed, as the man himself had it, the most important moment in the history of the program \u2013 was Meldrum\u2019s catastrophic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efOk7jEZHZc\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">interview with a youthful Prince Charles</a>, during which he repeatedly fluffed his lines, swore, put his hand on the Prince\u2019s knee while calling him \u201clovey\u201d and referred to his mum (\u201cYou mean Her Majesty the Queen,\u201d came the unctuous reply).</p>\n<p>The wonder of this scene is, of course, amazement that it happened at all. But the 1970s were different days: the ABC still played God Save the Queen before it ceased broadcasting at midnight but it was also a time when AC/DC\u2019s Bon Scott, wearing a schoolgirl\u2019s uniform and pigtails, could smoke a durrie while attacking Angus Young with a rubber mallet on the national broadcaster.</p>\n<p>Whether inept or insouciant, Meldrum\u2019s treatment of Charles said much about our history and our relationship with our colonial masters. But it also spoke of Meldrum\u2019s almost comic inability to be anyone other than himself and his determination to treat everybody \u2013 as his grandmother taught him \u2013 in the same way. Molly the miniseries is a funny, warm and wholeheartedly affectionate tribute.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Episode two of Molly airs on Sunday 14 February at 8.30pm on Seven</em></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

The Liverpudlian was content at the prospect, stating he was confident of surpassing his best-ever 34-goal tally for the club in a single campaign.</p>\n<p>However, Rooney has struggled for form and often been asked to operate in the No10 berth. The 30-year-old has seven goals and is the side\u2019s top scorer. Yet during United\u2019s 0-0 draw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/25/manchester-united-psv-eindhoven-champions-league-match-report\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">at home to PSV Eindhoven</a> on Wednesday, Keane was scathing about Rooney, saying: \u201cMentally he doesn\u2019t look sharp, physically he doesn\u2019t look in a great shape. He has to have a look at himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>That was brushed off by Van Gaal. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give the honour to answer this question because it is too much honour for the one who says things.\u201d</p>\n<p>The manager said it will be difficult for Rooney to score 25 goals as the England international is not currently the No9. \u201cAt this moment, he doesn\u2019t play in the striker\u2019s position, Martial is playing there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is possible he shall play other matches there. It is dependable not always on the quality and shape of the player at the moment, but also the gameplan. And we have to decide that every week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Van Gaal said Martial\u2019s form was blocking Rooney. \u201cIt is how Martial played when he was in the striker\u2019s position,\u201d the Dutchman said. \u201cI have to compare every player, then I think with playing like that, we are stronger. I shall always line up the strongest team of that moment. But that moment the other week can be different.\u201d</p>\n<p>Van Gaal said he always demands more of his squad. \u201cAs a manager you are never happy with the form and shape of a player,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot always be top of the bill. You always have something you want to be better, as a team and also as an individual player. You may think and criticise players or a team or a manager, but you have to do that with arguments, and not as a person. There is always something to improve the quality of a player, the quality of a team. Wayne is doing a lot, has a very great contribution in the team. So as a manager, I am satisfied with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Van Gaal\u2019s side has been criticised for their style. He is happy with the buildup play and believes the issue is profligate finishing. \u201cAs a manager, you cannot train that,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cYou can put them in a situation \u2013 we are doing that, we are training in the third or fourth phase. That is also the communication between the players. As a trainer-coach, you cannot give patterns for that.\u201d</p>\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element-rich-link--not-upgraded\" data-component=\"rich-link\" data-link-name=\"rich-link-1 | 1\">\n<div class=\"rich-link\">\n<div class=\"rich-link__container\">\n<p class=\"rich-link__header\">\n<h1 class=\"rich-link__title\">Wayne Rooney bullish over Champions League progress despite \u2018panicky\u2019 draw</h1>\n</p>\n\n<a class=\"rich-link__link u-faux-block-link__overlay\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/26/wayne-rooney-manchester-united-champions-league-knockout-stages\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<p>Jamie Vardy is aiming to score for an 11th consecutive Premier League match when United visit Leicester City on Saturday. \u201cIt shall be difficult [to stop him] I think but we can do that because we have a lot of clean sheets already [14].

They want the Government to 'recognise that gender-based inequality in pay is a serious problem' and make the money available, especially to local authorities which are the biggest single employer of women. And if negotiation does not succeed, Unison intend to take their battle to court. Fighting talk and commendable, too: equal pay laws have sat on the statute books for 25 years but women still earn, on average, three-quarters of what men earn.\n</p><p>But Unison are wasting their time. For behind all the convoluted explanations of unequal pay - domestic burdens leave women too exhausted to command much money in the workplace (a Nobel prize-winner); money is less important to women, so they don't ask for more (several psychologists); women tend to work for small employers who offer lower wages (business analysts) - lies the real question: who is doing what and how do we rank their efforts?</p>\n<p> We are so accustomed to a work force segregated along gender lines that we barely notice it (until we are surprised by a female plumber or a male nanny). But this is the essence of differential pay. It took a determined speech therapist 10 years of legal wrangling and a million pounds in fees to demonstrate that her work was equivalent in value to that of a clinical psychologist. But few have the tenacity or resources to consider this option. So the things women do are still considered of lower value than the things men do. </p>\n<p> One academic study compared the manufacture of paper and cardboard cartons. It found the former is mainly a female task, the latter largely a male one. Though the production processes were very similar, one was classified as higher skilled and better remunerated.</p>\n<p> No prizes for guessing which one.</p>\n<p> The same thing happens when an activity transfers from one gender to another. Witness the fortunes of 19th-century clerks (male, comparatively high status, paid accordingly) and 20th-century secretaries (female, low status, poorly paid). The question is devilishly chicken and egg. Did the low status ease the admission of women or was it their arrival that diminished the status of the job? It is a question that has also arisen in politics. In Scandinavia, a large proportion of women were elected, just when MPs were no longer considered so significant in the political process. Sitting in the legislature of a small country, modestly paid and answering mountains of letters held less attraction for ambitious men. In the age of global capitalism, there was more power (and dosh) available running big business.</p>\n<p> The same thing appears to be happening here. When, in 1998, women occupied all the senior positions in Westminster - Leaders of the Commons and Lords, Chief Whip and Speaker - they were described as doing the 'nanny' roles, organising everybody, instead of heading big spending departments where the real action was.</p>\n<p> In the hundreds of years of male Chief Whips, no one ever referred to it as a nanny role.</p>\n<p> Conversely, Health and Education used to be described as 'soft' when they were the areas most frequently headed by women. Today, under male bosses, Health and Education are considered the tough frontline of government. If we woke up one day to find all surgeons or commercial lawyers were women, maybe these would be reclassified as 'glorified stitchers' or 'paper shufflers'.</p>\n<p> 'No matter what sphere of work women are hired for or select, like sediment in a wine bottle they settle to the bottom,' American writer Cynthia Epstein said.</p>\n<p> Good luck, Unison.</p>\n<p>\u0095 Suzanne Franks is the author of Having None Of It: Women, Men And The Future Of Work, published by Granta at \u00a312.99.</p>\n<p> \u0095 To order at the special price of \u00a310.99 plus 99p UK p&amp;p, freephone 0500 600 102 or send a cheque to The Guardian CultureShop, 250 Western Ave, London W3 6EE.</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",
