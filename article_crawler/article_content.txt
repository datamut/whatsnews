He is a father of two young children and a popular, talented sportsman who excels at rugby and golf. If you got to know him well, you might discover a few quirks. He doesn\u2019t permit any black in his house. There won\u2019t ever be a leather sofa in his living room. He will never stock up on Jaffa Cakes for his kitchen cupboard. And he won\u2019t allow his four-year-old son to have a bunk bed.</p>\n<p>His partner, Emily, discovered the reason when she found him curled in a ball by their spare bed, a sweating \u201cgibbering wreck\u201d after they argued one day six years ago: \u201cI can still see him there, cowering, a big man, trying to get under the bed. He was like a little boy, whimpering, not lucid, as if he was in a flashback. I managed to get him on to the bed and held him, which normally he doesn\u2019t let me do. That was a pivotal moment, seeing what was going on in his head.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the first year of their relationship, James hinted that he\u2019d had a horrible time at school. Emily wasn\u2019t given the whole story at once but, gradually, the secret that he\u2019d kept close for more than 30 years came out: the physical and sexual abuse he\u2019d suffered when he was nine years old.</p>\n<p>In 1980, James\u2019s parents, a businessman and a teacher, decided that their eldest son would benefit from a private education at a boarding school in Suffolk. St George\u2019s was an impressive-looking former stately home with a sweeping drive. On his first night, he and other homesick boys were hauled out of their metal bunk-beds by two prefects. Wearing slippers, a dressing gown and starchy new pyjamas, James was led along corridors until he came to a black door beneath a winding staircase. They could hear\u00a0crying.</p>\n<p>Inside was a long leather sofa, a big desk on which lay a cane and a contraption that resembled an oversized table-tennis bat and two men: Derek Slade, the headmaster, and Gerard Singer, the head of languages. James does not like to call them by their names. For him, it dignifies them. \u201cI built up such a resilience to them. I\u2019d prefer \u2018him\u2019 to be \u2018it\u2019,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>James was ordered to turn around and drop his trousers. Then he was whacked with \u201csix of the best\u201d. After a few weeks and more beatings \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re punished for crying, you\u2019re punished for not having your shoes polished, it was all very regimented\u201d \u2013 James was summoned again to the room with the black door. There, waiting, were the same two teachers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knocked on the black door and walked into the room and Slade was behind his desk. My normal thing was to go and adopt my position and drop my trousers, and I stood there waiting. I didn\u2019t take much notice but his trousers were round his ankles. I was waiting for the cane and he came over and thrust his penis into me and that was the first time he raped me.\u201d</p>\n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\">\n<span class=\"inline-quote inline-icon inline-tone-fill\">\n<svg viewbox=\"0 0 33 20\" class=\"inline-tone-fill__svg inline-quote__svg inline-icon__svg\">\n<path d=\"M9.002 20c3.85.068 6.932-3.104 7-6.994.068-3.892-3.15-6.937-7-7.006-2.016-.036-3.59.694-4.888 2.053-.07-.48-.122-1.04-.113-1.553C4.065 2.97 7.415.937 11.004 1l-1-1C3.98 0 .098 4.447.003 10.006c-.098 5.557 3.35 9.892 9 9.994zm17 0c3.85.068 6.932-3.104 7-6.994.068-3.892-3.15-6.937-7-7.006-2.016-.036-3.59.694-4.888 2.053-.07-.48-.122-1.04-.113-1.553.064-3.53 3.414-5.563 7.003-5.5l-1-1c-6.022 0-9.904 4.447-10 10.006-.097 5.557 3.35 9.892 9 9.994z\"/>\n</svg> </span>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"pullquote-paragraph\">My relationships haven\u2019t been intimate or cuddly.

They said, \u2018Take three Jaffa Cakes\u2019. When you\u2019re away from home and the school meals are absolutely awful, a Jaffa Cake was like Willy Wonka\u2019s Golden Ticket.\u201d</p>\n<p>James was raped between 25 and 30 times by both teachers in a year, before they abruptly left the school without explanation. \u201cYou go home at Christmas just a broken child. I just can\u2019t get excited by Christmas now. All these things have triggers in later life.\u201d</p>\n<p>After they fell in love, Emily became used to James\u2019s reluctance to be tactile. Their first house had a galley kitchen. \u201cYou just can\u2019t share that space. It\u2019s like a forcefield around him. He will flinch if I go to touch him,\u201d she says. \u201cJames is not in any way violent or physically abusive. I\u2019ve never feared that he would be to any of us, but there is a swirling vortex of negative energy around him. It comes into the room with him and it\u2019s bigger than him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy relationships haven\u2019t been intimate or cuddly, I don\u2019t do all that,\u201d says James. \u201cHolding hands, touching someone\u2019s shoulder at a party, which is normal in normal relationships, is not normal for me. I look at other couples and it tortures me that I\u2019m not able to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt also tortures me to see the closeness between other couples,\u201d adds Emily. \u201cI desperately want it too. Living like this is very lonely.\u201d</p>\n<p>Around the time Emily came to understand his past, James discovered several old schoolmates on Facebook discussing the arrest of their former headmaster, Derek Slade. \u201cI was really struggling with life. I was near Ipswich, where the trial was, and went into the public gallery. I saw this shrivelled old man with a big Santa Claus beard in the dock. I looked at him and he looked at me. It put the fear of God into me. I just got up and walked out.\u201d</p>\n<figure itemprop=\"associatedMedia image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" data-component=\"image\" class=\"element element-image img--landscape  fig--narrow-caption fig--has-shares \" data-media-id=\"63ec5a619e78d806d37ab69bad907edc0e5cc694\" id=\"img-2\">\n<meta itemprop=\"url\" content=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63ec5a619e78d806d37ab69bad907edc0e5cc694/0_0_5574_3344/5574.jpg?w=700&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=63b0492874d4031a93257ae8bf9f3c3b\"/>\n<meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"5574\"/>\n<meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"3344\"/>\n<a href=\"#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\" data-link-name=\"Launch Article Lightbox\" data-is-ajax=\"\">\n <span class=\"inline-expand-image inline-icon centered-icon rounded-icon article__fullscreen modern-visible\">\n<svg viewbox=\"0 0 22 22\" class=\"centered-icon__svg rounded-icon__svg article__fullscreen__svg modern-visible__svg inline-expand-image__svg inline-icon__svg\">\n<path d=\"M3.4 20.2L9 14.5 7.5 13l-5.7 5.6L1 14H0v7.5l.5.5H8v-1l-4.6-.8M18.7 1.9L13 7.6 14.4 9l5.7-5.7.5 4.7h1.2V.6l-.5-.5H14v1.2l4.7.6\"/>\n</svg> </span> </a>\n\n<figcaption class=\"caption caption--img caption caption--img\" itemprop=\"description\">\nGiving evidence in court was harrowing for James but afterwards, \u2018the weight went from my shoulders,\u2019 he says.

Although Emily knew about his childhood trauma, James was still reluctant to share the progress of his case, which took six years to come to trial. He was upset when a new police liaison officer casually asked him what his case was about (she hadn\u2019t bothered to check) and when he was told there wasn\u2019t time to visit the court before the trial to familiarise himself with the surroundings. \u201cI felt I was always chasing the police,\u201d he says. \u201cI was expecting a bit more support. Since the trial, I\u2019ve heard nothing from them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuite often things would be terrible between us and only afterwards it would transpire that something had happened with the police or the court case,\u201d says Emily. \u201cI\u2019ve tried many times to ask him about his experiences. On the one hand, I have to be sensitive and not pry. On the other, I\u2019ve been pushed away quite venomously so many times, I\u2019m reluctant to put myself there. He keeps himself this closed book. I\u2019m a very open person but in order to preserve my own sanity I\u2019ve had to emotionally turn away.\u201d</p>\n<p>In this way, the abuse \u201cdoesn\u2019t stop when it stopped 35 years ago\u201d, says Emily. \u201cThe evil is still within our family because it has its impact on him and his behaviour and we\u2019re living with that every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>James, she says, is \u201cquite reluctant\u201d to seek help. At first, they tried couples counselling but Emily says it didn\u2019t really work. She believes he needs specialist counselling. \u201cIt takes him a long time to build up trust in the counsellor,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Giving evidence against his abuser in court was \u201cthe most harrowing thing I\u2019ve had to do in my life,\u201d says James. \u201cIt could go two ways. You could be believed or you could be back in there for contempt of court.\u201d</p>\n<p>On the day he was called to give evidence, their four-year-old son, Billy, could tell he was upset.</p>\n<p>James and Emily told him that Daddy had to sort out some problems at work. Billy disappeared and then returned. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you Daddy. I\u2019ve got Captain Barnacles. He\u2019s there to protect you.\u201d</p>\n<p>James put Captain Barnacles \u2013 the leader of the Octonauts cartoon \u2013 in his pocket when he stood in the witness box. \u201cWhen it was getting harrowing, I pulled him out and just broke down. I said to the jury, \u2018I\u2019ve got a four-year-old boy and a 10-month-old girl who are in this big world and I\u2019m going to do my damnedest to protect them.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\">\n<span class=\"inline-quote inline-icon inline-tone-fill\">\n<svg viewbox=\"0 0 33 20\" class=\"inline-tone-fill__svg inline-quote__svg inline-icon__svg\">\n<path d=\"M9.002 20c3.85.068 6.932-3.104 7-6.994.068-3.892-3.15-6.937-7-7.006-2.016-.036-3.59.694-4.888 2.053-.07-.48-.122-1.04-.113-1.553C4.065 2.97 7.415.937 11.004 1l-1-1C3.98 0 .098 4.447.003 10.006c-.098 5.557 3.35 9.892 9 9.994zm17 0c3.85.068 6.932-3.104 7-6.994.068-3.892-3.15-6.937-7-7.006-2.016-.036-3.59.694-4.888 2.053-.07-.48-.122-1.04-.113-1.553.064-3.53 3.414-5.563 7.003-5.5l-1-1c-6.022 0-9.904 4.447-10 10.006-.097 5.557 3.35 9.892 9 9.994z\"/>\n</svg> </span>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"pullquote-paragraph\">I\u2019ve suffered torment.

I\u2019d been living with this block of stone for four years and now he was starting to show some emotion.

This didn\u2019t happen often, and not nearly as often as my parents\u2019 generation experienced, but for me it was a taste of what racism is and does. Racism is hateful and it damages people.</p>\n<p>What <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/pauline-hanson\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" class=\"u-underline\">Pauline Hanson</a> did on Wednesday night in our national parliament was a racist and bigoted speech that sought to divide and hurt people. She chose to scapegoat an entire community for the problems some people experience. It was a calculated and shameful speech designed to stoke fear and division in our community.</p>\n<p>Like many Australians, my Greens colleagues and I were bracing for Pauline Hanson\u2019s speech on Wednesday night like never before for a parliamentarian\u2019s first speech. Two decades ago we\u2019d all witnessed the damage words by this same public figure sought to do to people, to whole communities, to a nation. So as this Senator Hanson was preparing to do damage once more, my Greens colleagues and I shared our concerns and discussed what we might do if she crossed a line. </p>\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded\" data-component=\"rich-link\" data-link-name=\"rich-link-2 | 1\">\n<div class=\"rich-link\">\n<div class=\"rich-link__container\">\n<p class=\"rich-link__header\">\n<h1 class=\"rich-link__title\">Pauline Hanson calls for immigration ban: 'Go back to where you came from'</h1>\n</p>\n\n<a class=\"rich-link__link u-faux-block-link__overlay\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/pauline-hanson-first-speech-senate-calls-for-immigration-ban\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<p>We were guided by the words of Australian of the Year Lieutenant General David Morrison who said that \u201cthe standard you walk past is the standard you accept\u201d.</p>\n<p>Senator Hanson didn\u2019t just cross a line, she deliberately trashed it.</p>\n<p>We chose to walk out of the Senate while Ms Hanson was speaking because we did not want to give any kind of legitimacy to her racist views and to the racist views of others by sitting and listening with the respect usually afforded to parliamentarians during their first speech.</p>\n<p>We believed that as Muslims across the country heard the words and felt the hate directed at them from Pauline Hanson\u2019s speech it was important her message was countered, drowned out if possible, by messages of welcome and respect.</p>\n<p>And we felt an obligation to stand up for not only Muslims but for the millions of Australians who welcome multiculturalism and an Australia that does not judge you on the colour of your skin or your religious beliefs.</p>\n<p>Some have suggested that by walking out we were taking Pauline Hanson seriously and granting her power she did not deserve. But the uncomfortable fact is that Pauline Hanson does have power; she was elected into the parliament, not through preferences but in her own right.</p>\n<p>Senator Hanson has received unprecedented levels of coverage of her racist views, even as a paid commentator by network news. To suggest she could just be allowed to preach hate and fade into the background is ludicrous. And to suggest the Greens elevated the coverage of her second maiden speech is similarly so. The coverage would have been those hateful words beamed into living rooms and personal devices across the globe but with no strong counter message that this is not Australia.</p>\n<p>The 45th Parliament risks being the most divisive parliament in Australia\u2019s history but it doesn\u2019t have to be. Moments like those we saw this week should be used by parliamentarians as opportunities to bring communities together not to divide them. If feedback by the Muslim community is anything to go by I believe we did just that.</p>\n<p>Yesterday as news of the Greens \u201cwalk out\u201d spread the phones in my office began to ring off the hook. In the morning the callers were mainly men who supported Pauline Hanson, angry at what we had done. Then, something remarkable began to happen.

Late one Saturday night I heard boys yelling and loud music, and the thumping against the walls was so hard one of my picture frames fell off and cracked on the floor. I presumed the neighbours had a teenager who was throwing a cheeky party while their parents were away. When it happened again the following weekend I assumed it was a repeat. However, a few weekends later it was girls yelling, playing what I recognised to be the true hymn of the hen party, You Can Leave Your Hat On. Suddenly it made sense: I was living next door to a sublet playing host to hen parties and stag dos most weekends.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve had men wrestling on the floor outside my flat, someone trying to kick in my door, and fights that have left blood smears across the corridor walls. I\u2019d refrained from complaining to the building manager or letting agents and tried to deal with the host directly.</p>\n<p>I had nothing against someone trying to make a little extra cash over the weekend. It was when it became clear the property was being entirely used for short-term rentals, and after my second phone call to the police, that I started complaining. I complained to the building manager, to my landlord, to the council.

Then he was kept awake by late-night noise. \u201cThe irritation was that it was very difficult to get in touch with the owner via the Airbnb website.

The site reviews whether your complaint matches up with an active Airbnb listing, then messages the host. If problems persist, the website says it can suspend or remove them from Airbnb entirely.

Many cities have begun to introduce new rules, after residents complained about being overwhelmed by weekend visitors banging wheelie bags up stairs, breaching building security rules, and loud parties. Pressure has also come from hotel groups and local politicians who have lost revenue from hotel taxes. </p>\n<p><strong>Berlin</strong><br/>In June, a court upheld Berlin\u2019s de facto ban on short-term rentals. People who let more than 50% of their apartment on a short-term basis without a permit risk a fine of \u20ac100,000 (\u00a385,000). City authorities were concerned that the availability of affordable housing was being severely threatened by the rise of short-term letting. Munich and Hamburg have also taken steps to curb <br/>short-term lets. </p>\n<p><strong>San Francisco </strong><br/>The city that is home to Airbnb\u2019s HQ is also one of its fiercest opponents. Hosts have to register with the authorities; if Airbnb advertises an un\u00adregistered property it can be fined $1,000 (\u00a3755) a day for each listing. An action group in the city has posted \u201cwanted\u201d flyers. The crime? \u201cAirbnb\u2019ing our community\u201d and \u201cdestroying affordable housing for immigrant, minority, and low income families\u201d. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>New York</strong> <br/>The city\u2019s rental laws ban apartments in buildings with three or more units from being rented out for less than 30 days. Landlords who flout the ban can be fined as much as $7,500. But home \u00adsharing \u2013 where the host is \u00adpresent \u2013 is legal. Critics say that short-term rental companies like Airbnb are \u00adflooding the city\u2019s housing \u00admarket, reducing available housing stock citywide by 10%, \u00adaccording to a study released in June. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Barcelona</strong></p>\n<figure itemprop=\"associatedMedia image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" data-component=\"image\" class=\"element element-image img--landscape  fig--narrow-caption fig--has-shares \" data-media-id=\"9ca17518f67a6ead3c680c855818d6b1e16cc792\" id=\"img-3\">\n<meta itemprop=\"url\" content=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ca17518f67a6ead3c680c855818d6b1e16cc792/0_399_5928_3558/5928.jpg?w=700&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d7daf720e58e98c66f3b94f85b5f4aa2\"/>\n<meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"5928\"/>\n<meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"3558\"/>\n<a href=\"#img-3\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\" data-link-name=\"Launch Article Lightbox\" data-is-ajax=\"\">\n <span class=\"inline-expand-image inline-icon centered-icon rounded-icon article__fullscreen modern-visible\">\n<svg viewbox=\"0 0 22 22\" class=\"centered-icon__svg rounded-icon__svg article__fullscreen__svg modern-visible__svg inline-expand-image__svg inline-icon__svg\">\n<path d=\"M3.4 20.2L9 14.5 7.5 13l-5.7 5.6L1 14H0v7.5l.5.5H8v-1l-4.6-.8M18.7 1.9L13 7.6 14.4 9l5.7-5.7.5 4.7h1.2V.6l-.5-.5H14v1.2l4.7.6\"/>\n</svg> </span> </a>\n\n<figcaption class=\"caption caption--img caption caption--img\" itemprop=\"description\">\nBarcelona is popular for Airbnb rentals.

Oddly however, they both ignored the news and preferred to talk about the deal they made with Liberal party room on superannuation.</p>\n<p>When the ABS announced that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 5.6%, the lowest since July 2013 \u2013 that is at any time during the Abbott/Turnbull period of government \u2013 you would have expected the boasting to have been long and loud.</p>\n<p>And yet there was mostly silence.</p>\n<p>The employment minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/michaelia-cash\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" class=\"u-underline\">Michaelia Cash</a> gave a brief press conference, and during Senate question time after questions from her own side on superannuation, defence, innovation and science she was asked about the figures \u2013 not exactly it a high priority.</p>\n<p>Anyone who tuned into the House of Representatives question time, however, would have found nothing to enlighten them on the current state of the labour market. The prime minister was even given a nice broad question about the government\u2019s \u201ccommitment to deliver economic security for Australians\u201d. </p>\n<p>In his response, the closest he came to talking of the figures was to note that \u201cjobs are growing\u201d. </p>\n<p>That at least was closer than the treasurer came to mentioning the good figures. All Morrison wanted to talk about was the changes to the superannuation system. </p>\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded\" data-component=\"rich-link\" data-link-name=\"rich-link-1 | 1\">\n<div class=\"rich-link\">\n<div class=\"rich-link__container\">\n<p class=\"rich-link__header\">\n<h1 class=\"rich-link__title\">Australia's unemployment rate reaches lowest level in three years</h1>\n</p>\n\n<a class=\"rich-link__link u-faux-block-link__overlay\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/australias-unemployment-rate-reaches-lowest-level-in-three-years\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<p>The closest anyone came to talking about the actual situation of jobs was Christopher Pyne <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F9de5f081-9ccf-4f72-a05a-02462c1f3a0c%2F0114%22\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">who told parliament</a> that \u201cwe created over 200,000 jobs in the last 12 months\u201d (it was actually 191,000 in trend terms or 180,000 in seasonally adjusted, so not quite 200,000 let alone \u201cover\u201d). </p>\n<p>In both houses the big issue was the changes to superannuation. </p>\n<p>The lack of attention on actual unemployment highlights the triumph of the \u201cbudget is the economy\u201d argument, where anything that reduces the budget deficit is considered an inherent good. </p>\n<p>It also highlights that despite the impressive overall unemployment rate, the employment situation is not that good.</p>\n<p>Malcolm Turnbull suggested that \u201cjobs are growing\u201d, but mostly it is part-time jobs that are growing and even overall job growth is slowing dramatically.</p>\n<p>Last year in the first eight months 191,000 jobs were created; this year it is just 83,900. The situation for full-time work is particularly bad \u2013 there are now 21,000 fewer full-time jobs than there were in December. </p>\n<p>And August also saw a record set for the level of underemployed workers. </p>\n<p>So it is no surprise really that the government was happy to focus on superannuation reforms which reduce the budget deficit. </p>\n<p>And what was the upshot of these reforms? </p>\n<p>The prime minister noted that 96% of people would be better off or unaffected. Among of those who will \u201cbenefit\u201d are low-income earners who will profit from the government replacing the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/Growing/Low-income-super-contribution/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">low income super contribution</a>,\u201d which is worth up to $500 a year with the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Super/Introducing-a-Low-Income-Superannuation-Tax-Offset/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">low income superannuation tax offset</a>,\u201d which is worth up to ... err ... $500 a year.</p>\n<p>And just how adversely affected the remaining 4% will be is up for debate. </p>\n<p>The high-income-earner-friendly Australian Financial Review headlined an article on the policy with \u201cWealthy are the winners in Coalition\u2019s superannuation deal\u201d. It also led another article explaining what the \u201cchanges mean for you\u201d by noting that \u201cwealthy savers were granted a last chance to stash up to $540,000 from after-tax earnings before the end of the financial year\u201d.</p>\n<p>So you would be right in wondering just how big a hair cut the very wealthy will be having. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that the savings to the budget are estimated to be roughly $3bn over the next four years. That sounds big until you realise Treasury estimates the amount of revenue foregone through superannuation tax concessions is around $140bn over that same period. </p>\n<p>And the changes to the policy \u2013 which among other things saw a backflip on the proposal to impose a $500,000 lifetime limit on post-tax contributions \u2013 was not arrived at though some great bipartisan negotiation. The negotiation was all within the Liberal party room and effectively involved giving the disgruntled and very emboldened rightwing of the party room what it wanted. </p>\n<p>The ALP will pass the changes \u2013 there is no reason not to \u2013 and there will be many a story about backflips or good deal-making, and others about how the government is at least making steps to improve the budget, and how important and good that is. </p>\n<p>The government for the most part will welcome such stories \u2013 for they will spin the narrative as best they can. And better those stories than focussing on how for the employment situation looks a lots less buoyant than it was 12 months ago when Turnbull took office.</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>", "summary": "At 5.6% Australia\u2019s unemployment rate is at its lowest in three years, but true jobs market picture doesn\u2019t fit the government\u2019s economic narrative"}

He was like a little boy, whimpering, not lucid, as if he was in a flashback. I managed to get him on to the bed and held him, which normally he doesn\u2019t let me do. That was a pivotal moment, seeing what was going on in his head.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the first year of their relationship, James hinted that he\u2019d had a horrible time at school. Emily wasn\u2019t given the whole story at once but, gradually, the secret that he\u2019d kept close for more than 30 years came out: the physical and sexual abuse he\u2019d suffered when he was nine years old.</p>\n<p>In 1980, James\u2019s parents, a businessman and a teacher, decided that their eldest son would benefit from a private education at a boarding school in Suffolk. St George\u2019s was an impressive-looking former stately home with a sweeping drive. On his first night, he and other homesick boys were hauled out of their metal bunk-beds by two prefects. Wearing slippers, a dressing gown and starchy new pyjamas, James was led along corridors until he came to a black door beneath a winding staircase. They could hear\u00a0crying.</p>\n<p>Inside was a long leather sofa, a big desk on which lay a cane and a contraption that resembled an oversized table-tennis bat and two men: Derek Slade, the headmaster, and Gerard Singer, the head of languages. James does not like to call them by their names. For him, it dignifies them. \u201cI built up such a resilience to them. I\u2019d prefer \u2018him\u2019 to be \u2018it\u2019,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>James was ordered to turn around and drop his trousers. Then he was whacked with \u201csix of the best\u201d. After a few weeks and more beatings \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re punished for crying, you\u2019re punished for not having your shoes polished, it was all very regimented\u201d \u2013 James was summoned again to the room with the black door. There, waiting, were the same two teachers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knocked on the black door and walked into the room and Slade was behind his desk. My normal thing was to go and adopt my position and drop my trousers, and I stood there waiting. I didn\u2019t take much notice but his trousers were round his ankles. I was waiting for the cane and he came over and thrust his penis into me and that was the first time he raped me.\u201d</p>\n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\">\n<span class=\"inline-quote inline-icon inline-tone-fill\">\n<svg viewbox=\"0 0 33 20\" class=\"inline-tone-fill__svg inline-quote__svg inline-icon__svg\">\n<path d=\"M9.002 20c3.85.068 6.932-3.104 7-6.994.068-3.892-3.15-6.937-7-7.006-2.016-.036-3.59.694-4.888 2.053-.07-.48-.122-1.04-.113-1.553C4.065 2.97 7.415.937 11.004 1l-1-1C3.98 0 .098 4.447.003 10.006c-.098 5.557 3.35 9.892 9 9.994zm17 0c3.85.068 6.932-3.104 7-6.994.068-3.892-3.15-6.937-7-7.006-2.016-.036-3.59.694-4.888 2.053-.07-.48-.122-1.04-.113-1.553.064-3.53 3.414-5.563 7.003-5.5l-1-1c-6.022 0-9.904 4.447-10 10.006-.097 5.557 3.35 9.892 9 9.994z\"/>\n</svg> </span>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"pullquote-paragraph\">My relationships haven\u2019t been intimate or cuddly.

They said, \u2018Take three Jaffa Cakes\u2019. When you\u2019re away from home and the school meals are absolutely awful, a Jaffa Cake was like Willy Wonka\u2019s Golden Ticket.\u201d</p>\n<p>James was raped between 25 and 30 times by both teachers in a year, before they abruptly left the school without explanation. \u201cYou go home at Christmas just a broken child. I just can\u2019t get excited by Christmas now. All these things have triggers in later life.\u201d</p>\n<p>After they fell in love, Emily became used to James\u2019s reluctance to be tactile. Their first house had a galley kitchen. \u201cYou just can\u2019t share that space. It\u2019s like a forcefield around him. He will flinch if I go to touch him,\u201d she says. \u201cJames is not in any way violent or physically abusive. I\u2019ve never feared that he would be to any of us, but there is a swirling vortex of negative energy around him. It comes into the room with him and it\u2019s bigger than him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy relationships haven\u2019t been intimate or cuddly, I don\u2019t do all that,\u201d says James. \u201cHolding hands, touching someone\u2019s shoulder at a party, which is normal in normal relationships, is not normal for me. I look at other couples and it tortures me that I\u2019m not able to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt also tortures me to see the closeness between other couples,\u201d adds Emily. \u201cI desperately want it too. Living like this is very lonely.\u201d</p>\n<p>Around the time Emily came to understand his past, James discovered several old schoolmates on Facebook discussing the arrest of their former headmaster, Derek Slade. \u201cI was really struggling with life. I was near Ipswich, where the trial was, and went into the public gallery. I saw this shrivelled old man with a big Santa Claus beard in the dock. I looked at him and he looked at me. It put the fear of God into me. I just got up and walked out.\u201d</p>\n<figure itemprop=\"associatedMedia image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" data-component=\"image\" class=\"element element-image img--landscape  fig--narrow-caption fig--has-shares \" data-media-id=\"63ec5a619e78d806d37ab69bad907edc0e5cc694\" id=\"img-2\">\n<meta itemprop=\"url\" content=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63ec5a619e78d806d37ab69bad907edc0e5cc694/0_0_5574_3344/5574.jpg?w=700&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=63b0492874d4031a93257ae8bf9f3c3b\"/>\n<meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"5574\"/>\n<meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"3344\"/>\n<a href=\"#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\" data-link-name=\"Launch Article Lightbox\" data-is-ajax=\"\">\n <span class=\"inline-expand-image inline-icon centered-icon rounded-icon article__fullscreen modern-visible\">\n<svg viewbox=\"0 0 22 22\" class=\"centered-icon__svg rounded-icon__svg article__fullscreen__svg modern-visible__svg inline-expand-image__svg inline-icon__svg\">\n<path d=\"M3.4 20.2L9 14.5 7.5 13l-5.7 5.6L1 14H0v7.5l.5.5H8v-1l-4.6-.8M18.7 1.9L13 7.6 14.4 9l5.7-5.7.5 4.7h1.2V.6l-.5-.5H14v1.2l4.7.6\"/>\n</svg> </span> </a>\n\n<figcaption class=\"caption caption--img caption caption--img\" itemprop=\"description\">\nGiving evidence in court was harrowing for James but afterwards, \u2018the weight went from my shoulders,\u2019 he says.

Although Emily knew about his childhood trauma, James was still reluctant to share the progress of his case, which took six years to come to trial. He was upset when a new police liaison officer casually asked him what his case was about (she hadn\u2019t bothered to check) and when he was told there wasn\u2019t time to visit the court before the trial to familiarise himself with the surroundings. \u201cI felt I was always chasing the police,\u201d he says. \u201cI was expecting a bit more support. Since the trial, I\u2019ve heard nothing from them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuite often things would be terrible between us and only afterwards it would transpire that something had happened with the police or the court case,\u201d says Emily. \u201cI\u2019ve tried many times to ask him about his experiences. On the one hand, I have to be sensitive and not pry. On the other, I\u2019ve been pushed away quite venomously so many times, I\u2019m reluctant to put myself there. He keeps himself this closed book. I\u2019m a very open person but in order to preserve my own sanity I\u2019ve had to emotionally turn away.\u201d</p>\n<p>In this way, the abuse \u201cdoesn\u2019t stop when it stopped 35 years ago\u201d, says Emily. \u201cThe evil is still within our family because it has its impact on him and his behaviour and we\u2019re living with that every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>James, she says, is \u201cquite reluctant\u201d to seek help. At first, they tried couples counselling but Emily says it didn\u2019t really work. She believes he needs specialist counselling. \u201cIt takes him a long time to build up trust in the counsellor,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Giving evidence against his abuser in court was \u201cthe most harrowing thing I\u2019ve had to do in my life,\u201d says James. \u201cIt could go two ways. You could be believed or you could be back in there for contempt of court.\u201d</p>\n<p>On the day he was called to give evidence, their four-year-old son, Billy, could tell he was upset.</p>\n<p>James and Emily told him that Daddy had to sort out some problems at work. Billy disappeared and then returned. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you Daddy. I\u2019ve got Captain Barnacles. He\u2019s there to protect you.\u201d</p>\n<p>James put Captain Barnacles \u2013 the leader of the Octonauts cartoon \u2013 in his pocket when he stood in the witness box. \u201cWhen it was getting harrowing, I pulled him out and just broke down. I said to the jury, \u2018I\u2019ve got a four-year-old boy and a 10-month-old girl who are in this big world and I\u2019m going to do my damnedest to protect them.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\">\n<span class=\"inline-quote inline-icon inline-tone-fill\">\n<svg viewbox=\"0 0 33 20\" class=\"inline-tone-fill__svg inline-quote__svg inline-icon__svg\">\n<path d=\"M9.002 20c3.85.068 6.932-3.104 7-6.994.068-3.892-3.15-6.937-7-7.006-2.016-.036-3.59.694-4.888 2.053-.07-.48-.122-1.04-.113-1.553C4.065 2.97 7.415.937 11.004 1l-1-1C3.98 0 .098 4.447.003 10.006c-.098 5.557 3.35 9.892 9 9.994zm17 0c3.85.068 6.932-3.104 7-6.994.068-3.892-3.15-6.937-7-7.006-2.016-.036-3.59.694-4.888 2.053-.07-.48-.122-1.04-.113-1.553.064-3.53 3.414-5.563 7.003-5.5l-1-1c-6.022 0-9.904 4.447-10 10.006-.097 5.557 3.35 9.892 9 9.994z\"/>\n</svg> </span>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"pullquote-paragraph\">I\u2019ve suffered torment.
